# Jasmin

This repository contains the following subdirectories:

- compiler/pipeline-examples/: Examples and experiments of the
  pipeline cost analysis.
- compiler/ : Compiler from jasmin-lang to assembly.
  The compiler includes the pipeline cost analyzer.
- proofs/ : Coq implementations of compiler passes / checkers.

# Dependencies

- For the compiler: check compiler/README.md
  We recommand using Nix: simply use nix-shell in the root directory
  (*not* in the compiler/ directory) to automatically jump in a shell
  with all dependencies installed.
- For the proofs:
  + Coq (>= 8.7)
  + The Mathematical Components library for Coq (>= 1.9)

  Note that using nix-shell in the root directory will correctly install all
  Coq dependencies.

# Building the Jasmin compiler and the cost analyzer:

1. To compile, first compile the proofs:
   - `$ cd proofs; make)`
   - `$ make`
   - `$ cd ..`
   Then, back at the root directory, build the compiler:    
   - `$ cd compiler`
   - `$ make CIL build`
   - `$ make`
   Optionally, test the compiler:
   - `$ make tests`
2. To test the pipeline analyzer, once the compiler is built:
   - `$ cd compiler/pipeline-examples/`
   - `$ ./run-analysis` (bash version >= 4 required)
   - `$ ./run-analysis-crypto` (bash version >= 4 required, takes several hours)
   For more information please consult compiler/pipeline-examples/README.md
